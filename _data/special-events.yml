    description: "The Source is a beautiful evening of prayer, fellowship 
        and quality time with the Lord. We begin with some praise and worship, 
        followed by a student testimony of how God has worked in their life. 
        Then, we hear a talk from a priest, and finally we will spend one hour 
        in Adoration with the Lord at which time you will also have an opportunity 
        to go to confession. We close of the evening with pizza and lots of snacks!"
