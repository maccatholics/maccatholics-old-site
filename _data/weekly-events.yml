      helps us to dive into the true teachings of the Catholic Church, to have a Christ-centered 
      life and to have more meaningful and deeper relationships with God Himself, and with our 
      brothers and sisters in Christ. Come join us for JAM in room 224 of Divinity College 
      every Monday at 6:30 for a night of prayer, reflection and scripture."

    description: "Wondering about the Catholic faith? Looking for a community of inquisitive 
      and friendly people to hang out with? The Catholic Compass is a student group that helps 
      people deepen their understanding of the catholic faith by explaining difficult church 
      teaching and addressing modern issues. We introduce people to aspects of faith that 
      they may not be familiar with. Our meetings involve listening to a talk by a speaker 
      and transition into an open forum where we discuss and ask questions about the presented topic. 
      We invite anyone, Catholic or not, to come in and participate in the gathering. 
      Free refreshments provided! We cannot wait to see you there! God Bless."
